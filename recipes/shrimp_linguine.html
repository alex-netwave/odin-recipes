    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Drizzle some oil in a large pot of boiling salted 
            water, add 1 tablespoon of salt and the linguine, 
            and cook for 7 to 10 minutes, or according to the 
            directions on the package.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in another large (12-inch), heavy-bottomed 
            pan, melt the butter and olive oil over medium-low heat. 
            Add the garlic. Saute for 1 minute. Be careful, the garlic 
            burns easily! Add the shrimp, 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt, and 
            the pepper and saute until the shrimp have just turned pink,
             about 5 minutes, stirring often. Remove from the heat, 
            add the parsley, lemon zest, lemon juice, lemon slices, 
            and red pepper flakes. Toss to combine.</li>
        <li>When the pasta is done, drain the cooked linguine and 
            then put it back in the pot. Immediately add the shrimp
            and sauce, toss well, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
